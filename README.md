### Project Title
-------------------
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
------------------
This project was submitted as part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree. It involves using Python to build a program to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States including Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

Users can interact with the program to compare system usage between these cities based on descriptive statistics computed by the program.

#### Statistics computed:
#### 1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

#### 2. Popular stations and trip
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e. most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#### 3. Trip duration
- total travel time
- average travel time

#### 4. User information
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
